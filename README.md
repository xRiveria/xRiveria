Iâ€™m **Ryan Tan**, a software engineer from **Singapore**. As I juggle my time between further studies and freelance work, I dedicate whatever free time I have to hobby projects. I especially enjoy keeping myself up to date with the latest technological progressions in the industry! 

Work aside, I love exercising and keeping up with the latest television dramas. **Its all about keeping the mind sharp and the heart light!** :heart_eyes:

Some trivia about me:

* ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently undergoing further studies at **DigiPen Institute of Technology (Singapore)**, majoring in **Real-Time Interactive Simulation**. 

* ðŸ’» I'm particularly fond of all things relating to **game engine architecture, tools** and **graphics**. Don't hesitate to contact me if you would like to collaborate or simply to have educational discourse! 

* ðŸ“« When it comes to collaborative work, my top priority is to ensure an **intuitive/comfortable experience for my end-users**. After all, who wants to work on an interface who constantly fights back?

My public repositories are freely available for usage in your own projects! In the meantime, feel free to reach me at **ryan.tan.wt@gmail.com**. Cheers!
